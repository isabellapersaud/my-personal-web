    <p>Well, thats easy! My name is Isabella Persaud. I graduated from Stony Brook University in May of 2022 with my Bachelors of Science degree in Mathematics! 
        Although the past four years have been dedicated to my love for numbers, it is time for me to think even bigger, which is why I have decided to take the next 
        step in my career towards pursuing software engineering. I have always been curious on figuring out why things work the way they do, and have big dreams of taking this
        curiosity to the next level. Aside from my love of numbers, I love to take photographs; specifically of sunsets. This website will showcase some of the breathtaking 
        sunsets that I have been able to capture on my camera. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
    </p>

    <h3>Sunsets?</h3>
    <p>Ever since I was a little girl I have alawys been fascinated by nature. Rather than explaining "why sunsets," it may be better to simply show my audience.</p>
